#This is the firewall section, to work correctly it requires the IPSet and IPTables service,
#otherwise the hook will not be activated.
#It will only work if the start script has permissions to execute the commands, it may not
#work on sites that offer minecraft servers as a pterodactyl panel (aternos, elixirnode, server.pro, etc ...)

#Removing / changing one of these commands in case you don't know what
#you are doing is highly discouraged and could cause lag problems.
#
#Positive points:
#After about 5 minutes of attack the number of connections per second will be lowered to 50/100
#The time depends on the number of IPs to be blacklisted

#Negative points:
#Slower on spigot!
#There will be an increase of CPU usage during ip blacklisting (Especially on low-powered servers)
